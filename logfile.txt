Here is another random quote of wisdom for you:We've been through a couple of syntax changes, but I have sort of assumed that by the time we get to version 1.0 release, the language, (if not the implementation) will essentially be stable., Steven D.

Message receiver: b"Hello there ('50.27.44.119', 52895). Here is another random quote of wisdom for you:One of the things that makes it interesting, is exactly how much Guido has managed to exploit that one implementation trick of 'namespaces'., Steven D. Majewski, 17 Sep 1993\n"
Message receiver: b"Hello there ('50.27.44.119', 53230). Here is another random quote of wisdom for you:Python is an experiment in how much freedom programmers need. Too much freedom and nobody can read another's code; too little and expressiveness is endangered, Guido van Rossum, 13 Aug 1996\n"
Message receiver: b'Hello there (\'50.27.44.119\', 53282). Here is another random quote of wisdom for you:I\'ve seen Python criticized as "ugly" precisely because it doesn\'t have a trick-based view of the world. In many ways, it\'s a dull language, borrowing solid old concepts from many other languages & styles: boring syntax, unsurprising semantics, few automatic coercions, etc etc. But that\'s one of the things I like about it., Tim Peters, 16 Sep 1993\n'
Message receiver: b'Hello there (\'50.27.44.119\', 53323). Here is another random quote of wisdom for you:People simply will not agree on what should and shouldn\'t be "an error", and once exception-handling mechanisms are introduced to give people a choice, they will far less agree on what to do with them., Tim Peters, 17 Dec 1993\n'
